% difference equations have 0 as their first entry here to simplify index
% calculations slightly. Alternatively, it's also possible to swap this to the last element
% and reorder the comparison step (or omit on the last step). This is a
% special case when comparing a single time series to itself. The more general
% case with time series A,B can be computed using difference equations for
% each time series.
