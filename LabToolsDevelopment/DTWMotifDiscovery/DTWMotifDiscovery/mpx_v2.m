function [matrixProfile, matrixProfileIdx, motifsIdx, discordsIdx] = mpx_v2(timeSeries, minlag, subseqlen)
% matrixProfile - distance between each subsequence timeSeries(i : i + subseqLen - 1) 
%                 for i = 1 .... length(timeSeries) - subseqLen + 1, with the condition
%                 that the nearest neighbor of the ith subsequence is at least minlag steps
%                 away from it.
% 
% matrixProfileIdx - If matrixProfileIdx(i) == j, then |i - j| >= minlag
%                    and MatrixProfile(i) == norm(zscore(subseq(i), 1) - norm(zscore(subseq(j), 1));
%
% motifsIdx - A 10 x 3 matrix containing the indices of the top motifs and
%             their neighbors. The first two entries in each column
%             indicate a pair. The remaining entries in that column are their 
%             neighbors. This implementation picks motifs from best to
%             worst. It picks neighbors using a greedy strategy with an
%             excluded region applied after each pick to all subsequent
%             choices of motifs and neighbors. Outliers are picked first,
%             followed by the top motif and its neighbors, followed by the
%             second and third motifs in the same manner. This avoids
%             picking outliers as motifs on short time series.
%
%             The distance between a motif and its neighbor must be less than
%             two times the distance between a motif and its nearest
%             neighbor. This is not strict enough to guarantee any causal
%             relation, and in cases of weak matches, neighbors may vary
%             independently from the first pair (that is they may be
%             uncorrelated).
%
% discordsIdx - A 3 x 1 colum indicating the furthest outliers by maximal
%               normalized euclidean distance. These are chosen prior to
%               motifs in the current implementation.
%

% Code and update formulas are by Kaveh Kamgar.  
% GUI and top k motif critera are based on but not identical to some code
% by Michael Yeh. Implementation details are specified above.
% The suggested use of the fourier transform to compute Euclidean Distance based on normalized 
% cross correlation is influenced by a suggested implementation by Abdullah Mueen.
