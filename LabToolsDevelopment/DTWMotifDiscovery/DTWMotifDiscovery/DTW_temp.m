function distance = DTW(query,can_seq,force_plots)

% NOTE!!!! Very very slow code, just use it for making plots. There is code
% that is 1000s of times faster...

% function distance = DTW(query,can_seq,force_plots)    Tested under matlab 5.2
% (c) Eamonn Keogh, Michael Pazzani {eamonn,pazzani}@ics.uci.edu 1999.
%
% This function performs dynamic time warping on the two time series 'query' and 'can_seq'
% The two time series are assumed to be real numbers in a k by 1 vector. The time series may
% be of different lengths. The algorithms complexity is O(MN) were M = |query| and N = |can_seq|
%
% A good explanation of the algorithm can be found in Berndt, D. J., Clifford, J. 
% 'Using Dynamic Time Warping to Find Patterns in Time Series'. In KDD-94: 
% AAAI Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Pages 359-370, Seattle, Washington, July 1994. 
%
% The algorithm returns the DTW distance between 'query' and 'can_seq'.
%
% If you pass in a third 'dummy' argument, the function will spawn 4 plots which help to visualize the algorithm.
% Paste the following three lines of code into the Matlab workspace for a demo.
%
% 		Q  =  smooth(tan(tan(sin([-2:.05:2].^3)')));                                     %% Some demo data.
% 		C  =  smooth([tan(tan(sin([-2:.04:-.4].^3)'));tan(tan(sin([.4:.04:2].^3)')) ]);  %% Some more demo data.
% 		DTW(Q,C,1);                                                          %% Invoke the function.
%
% Note that in the above example the "red" time series needs to have its largest valley 'pushed' forward
% and it's largest peak 'pulled' back to achieve a good fit. This is exactly what the algorithm does.
%
% You can speed up (and constrain) the algorithm by changing the value of 'WARPING_WINDOW' below. See the paper
% by Berndt &  Clifford (page 234) for details.
